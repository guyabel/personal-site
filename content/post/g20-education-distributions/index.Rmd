## Demographic data by educational levels

A few months ago the [**wcde**](https://guyabel.github.io/wcde/index.html) package was released on to CRAN, to enable R users to directly download past data and future projections of demographic data by education data provided in the Wittgenstein Centre Human Capital Data Explorer](http://dataexplorer.wittgensteincentre.org/wcde-v2/). In this post I animate past and projected future changes using the data on education compositions in selected countries obtained using the **wcde** package.

## Changes since 1950 in educational compositions

To look at past changes educational compositions we can use the `past_epop` data frame in the **wcde** package

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(wcde)
head(past_epop)
```

To get only the G20 nations for plotting we can use the country codes package to look up the country code, given the names of each country
```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(countrycode)

g20 <- c("Australia", "Canada", "Saudi Arabia", "United States",
         "India", "Russia", "South Africa", "Turkey",  
         "Argentina", "Brazil", "Mexico",
         "France", "Germany", "Italy", "United Kingdom",
         "China", "Indonesia", "Japan", "South Korea")

g20_codes <- countrycode(sourcevar = g20, origin = "country.name", destination = "iso3n")

g20_codes
```

In the code below we use the `g20_codes` object to filter to the appropriate countries. As the education levels in the education specific population data sets in the Wittgenstein Centre Human Capital data explorer vary by country and year we can use the `edu_group_sum()` function to ensure all countries have population totals by six education groups. Finally, the data are summed over age and sex to provide single population counts for each country, year and education group. 
```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
d0 <- past_epop %>%
  filter(country_code %in% g20_codes) %>%
  edu_group_sum(n = 6) %>%
  group_by(name, year, education) %>%
  summarise(epop = sum(epop))
d0
```

To make visual comparisons easier in the plot we order the countries by the proportion of the population that are Under 15 in 1950;

```{r}
n <- d0 %>%
  filter(year == 2020) %>%
  group_by(name) %>%
  mutate(p_finish_secondary = sum(epop[6:7])/sum(epop)) %>%
  arrange(p_finish_secondary) %>%
  distinct(name) %>%
  pull(name) %>%
  as.character()
n
```

We update the `d0` data frame to take the ordering of the countries saved in object `n`. We also shorten the full name of the United Kingdom.

```{r}
d0 <- d0 %>%
  mutate(name = factor(name, levels = n)) %>%
  arrange(name) %>%
  mutate(name = countryname(sourcevar = name),
         name = fct_inorder(name))
d0
```

The data is then ready to pass to ggplot2 and gganimate

```{r}
library(gganimate)
a <- ggplot(data = d0, 
       mapping = aes(x = epop, y = name, fill = fct_rev(education))) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill", stat = "identity") +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = wic_col6, name = "Education") +
  transition_time(time = year) +
  labs(x = "Share of population", y = "",
       title = 'G20 Nations Education Distribution of Populations in {round(frame_time)}') +
  theme_bw()

animate(a, start_pause = 10, end_pause = 20)
```
