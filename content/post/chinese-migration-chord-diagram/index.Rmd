```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

We have had a number of requests for the R code to replicate the plots in our [paper](https://guyabel.com/publication/china-internal-migration-2010-15/) on internal migration in China. The code below will produce a similar looking plot, but I have taken out some of the arguments that were very specific to our plot that will not replicate well for other data. 

## Data

The code is based on two data sets:

1. Bilateral flow data with three columns only (origin, destination and flow), see [here](https://gist.github.com/guyabel/c24d990abc2c692f2b63747ee42909eb) for the file used below
2. Region details used for plotting, see [here](https://gist.github.com/guyabel/2f52e1593ad951800d83530a58ce0079) for the file used below

Note, the names in the region data are the same as the ones used in the origin and destination data. 

We can read in the data using `read_csv()` in the readr package
```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

d1 <- read_csv("https://gist.githubusercontent.com/guyabel/c24d990abc2c692f2b63747ee42909eb/raw/6b255edee7e01ca31b856152d18ae10ad50badd5/china_flow_2010_2015.csv")

d1 <- mutate(d1, flow = flow/1e6)
d1

d2 <- read_csv("https://gist.githubusercontent.com/guyabel/2f52e1593ad951800d83530a58ce0079/raw/165843fdd4afc61e17cd7658563e573c1e74fb57/china_region_details.csv")
d2
```

## Plot

The code below plots the chord diagram without the default labels and axis for the `chordDiagram()` function, that are added later in the `circos.track()` function.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(circlize)

circos.clear()
circos.par(track.margin = c(0.01, -0.01), start.degree = 90, gap.degree = d2$gap)

chordDiagram(x = d1, order = d2$name, 
             grid.col = d2$colour, transparency = 0.25,
             directional = 1, direction.type = c("diffHeight", "arrows"),
             link.arr.type = "big.arrow", diffHeight = -0.04, 
             link.sort = TRUE, link.largest.ontop = TRUE, 
             annotationTrack = "grid",
             preAllocateTracks = list(track.height = 0.25))

circos.track(track.index = 1, bg.border = NA, panel.fun = function(x, y) {
  s = get.cell.meta.data("sector.index")
  xx = get.cell.meta.data("xlim")
  circos.text(x = mean(xx), y = 0.2, 
              labels = s, cex = 0.7, adj = c(0, 0.5),
              facing = "clockwise", niceFacing = TRUE)
  circos.axis(h = "bottom",
              labels.cex = 0.5,
              labels.pos.adjust = FALSE,
              labels.niceFacing = FALSE)
})
```

The legend is added using the `legend()` function using the [Set1](http://colorbrewer2.org/#type=qualitative&scheme=Set1&n=4]) colour palette, that we used as the basis of regional shades in the colour column of `d2`; see the [shades]([https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/shades/index.html]) package for creating palettes of similar colours.

## Legend

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(RColorBrewer)
legend(x = 0.7, y = 1.1, 
       legend = unique(d2$region), 
       fill = brewer.pal(n = 4, name = "Set1"), 
       bty = "n", cex = 0.8,
       x.intersp = 0.5, 
       title = "   Region", title.adj = 0) 
```

## Saving

To save the image in a PDF plot surround the plotting code above between the `pdf()` function and `dev.off()` function. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
pdf(file = "figure1.pdf", width = 6, height = 6)

### insert code from above

dev.off()
```

## Image Files

To convert the PDF to a PNG file I recommend the [magick](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magick/) package:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(magick)
p <- image_read_pdf("figure1.pdf")
image_write(image = p, path = "figure1.png")
```

## Chinese Labels

To replace the labels with their Chinese names, as in the plot above, replace the code for the `s` object in the `circos.track()` function to:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
    s = d2 %>% 
      filter(name == get.cell.meta.data("sector.index")) %>%
      select(name_zh) %>%
      pull()
```

You might also need to add `family = "GB1"` in the `pdf()` function for Chinese characters to render in a PDF viewer.
