abstract = "In comparison with other developed nations, there is a relative lack of analyses on internal migration flow in South Korea. During the last 50 years, the country has witnessed distinct changes in both the levels and patterns of internal migration. Traditionally, the faster developing north-west administrative units (Seoul, Incheon and Gyeonggi regions) have accounted for the majority of in-migration. However, since 2011, internal migration in Korea has become more diffuse, with migrants moving to a greater variety of regions. We visualize these changes using chord diagram plots."
