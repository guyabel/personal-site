abstract = "An indirect estimation method is used to derive country to country migration flows from changes in global bilateral stock data. Estimates are obtained over five- and 10-year periods between 1960 and 2015 by gender, providing a comprehensive picture of past migration patterns. The estimated total of global international migrant flows generally increases over the 55-year time frame. The global rate of migration over five- and 10-year periods fluctuate at around 0.65 and 1.25 percent of the population, respectively. The sensitivity of estimates to alternative input stock and demographic data are explored."

## Further Notes

Please contact me if cannot access the full paper and would like a copy. 

A new paper presenting estimates of sex-specific five-year bilateral migration flows between 1990 and 2020 was published in [Scientific Data](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01271-z). The estimates in the new paper are from a range of methods, including the method presented in the International Migration Review article. The updated flow estimates can be downloaded from [Figshare collection](https://figshare.com/collections/Bilateral_international_migration_flow_estimates_by_sex/5800838) directly.
