I am researcher based at the [Asian Demographic Research Institute](http://adri-shanghai.github.io/) and [IIASA](http://www.iiasa.ac.at/web/home/research/researchPrograms/WorldPopulation/Introduction.html). I am also a Professor in the [School of Sociology and Political Science](http://en.shu.edu.cn/Default.aspx?tabid=26181) at Shanghai University. 

Previously I worked at the [Vienna Institute of Demography](http://www.oeaw.ac.at/vid/), the [ESRC Centre for Population Change](http://www.cpc.ac.uk/) and [S3RI](http://www.southampton.ac.uk/s3ri/) at the University of Southampton.

My day-to-day research covers estimating migration and applying statistical methods to better forecast components of population change. This website contains posts mainly related to my research, including some information on my [publications](./publication) and use of [R](./tags/r/). The site is the successor to my [WordPress](http://gjabel.wordpress.com/) blog which I had trouble accessing when in China.
